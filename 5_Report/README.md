# REPORT
# ABSTRACT:
   #### In this project a door sensor is connected to 1 bit of port b.
   #### Port c is connected to an led in which it can sense whether the door ids opened or not.
   #### Here an voltage regulator is kept for displaying the voltage to the door i.e switch and to the led.
   #### Input and output were kept for the efficient output. 
   #### And here atmega 328 microcontroller is used for the door sensor.
   


## INTRODUCTION 
#### In this project there will be a switch which acts as a door and an led which is connected in port c.
#### when the door is opened the led will glow sensing that the door has been opened.

## OBJECTIVE
#### The main objective of this project is to sense the door.
#### To sense whether it is open or closed.
