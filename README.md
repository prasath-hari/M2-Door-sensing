 # Sensing door
   ###### In this project a door sensor is connected to 1 bit of port b
   ###### Port c is connected to an led in which it can sense whether the door ids opened or not
   ###### Here an voltage regulator is kept for displaying the voltage to the door i.e switch and to the led
   ###### Input and output were kept for the efficient output 
   ###### And here atmega 328 microcontroller is used for the door sensor
